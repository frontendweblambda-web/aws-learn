Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs dive into **how to reduce WCU and RCU usage** in **Amazon DynamoDB**, which can significantly lower your costs and improve efficiency.

---

## üéØ GOAL: Reduce WCU/RCU usage (and therefore cost)

We‚Äôll cover **strategies for both**:

- üîµ **Reads (RCU)**
- üü† **Writes (WCU)**

Each has **technical trade-offs**, so I‚Äôll also explain **when** to use each.

---

# üîµ 1. **Reducing RCU Usage (Read Capacity Units)**

### ‚úÖ Techniques:

---

### üîπ A. Use **Eventually Consistent Reads**

- **RCU cost is 50% less** than strongly consistent reads.
- Ideal when you **don‚Äôt need the absolute latest data**, e.g., for analytics or user profiles.

| Type                  | Cost per 4 KB |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Strongly Consistent   | 1 RCU         |
| Eventually Consistent | 0.5 RCU       |

---

### üîπ B. Use **Query/Scan with Projections (select fewer attributes)**

- Only read the attributes (columns) you actually need.
- This reduces item size ‚Üí fewer RCUs.

```sql
# Example (pseudo):
SELECT user_id, last_login FROM users
```

- Avoid: `SELECT *`

---

### üîπ C. Implement **Data Compression**

- Store compressed blobs (e.g., using gzip, zlib).
- Reduces total item size, lowering RCU/WCU.

> Downside: You need to **decompress on read**, which may add latency.

---

### üîπ D. Use **Pagination** for Large Reads

- Read fewer items per request.
- Spread reads over time to avoid burst consumption and throttling.

---

### üîπ E. Use **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)**

- In-memory cache for DynamoDB
- Reduces **RCU usage to near-zero** for frequently read data
- Great for read-heavy apps like dashboards

---

### üîπ F. Cache Outside DynamoDB (App-Level Caching)

- Use Redis, Memcached, or in-memory caches in your app.
- Cache ‚Äúhot‚Äù items to avoid frequent reads.

---

---

# üü† 2. **Reducing WCU Usage (Write Capacity Units)**

### ‚úÖ Techniques:

---

### üî∏ A. **Batch Writes**

- Use `BatchWriteItem` to write **up to 25 items in one call**
- Reduces API overhead (but each item still costs WCU based on size)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No WCU savings per item, but fewer HTTP requests = better performance

---

### üî∏ B. **Reduce Item Size**

- DynamoDB bills **per 1 KB (rounded up)**.
- Shrink size by:

  - Shorter attribute names (`fn` instead of `first_name`)
  - Compress large payloads (e.g., JSON blobs)
  - Store large blobs in **S3** and save only reference (e.g., URL or ID)

---

### üî∏ C. **Avoid Frequent Overwrites**

- Writes that update the same item too often increase WCU use.
- Instead:

  - **Buffer writes** (e.g., write once every 10 seconds instead of every 1)
  - Use **update** operations instead of full item overwrites

---

### üî∏ D. **Use Condition Expressions to Prevent Unnecessary Writes**

Avoid rewriting items if nothing changed.

```python
ConditionExpression="attribute_not_exists(last_updated) OR last_updated <> :new_value"
```

Saves WCUs when data is identical.

---

### üî∏ E. **Use Streams + Aggregation Instead of Writing Every Event**

Example:

- IoT device sends 100 small updates/sec
- Instead of writing each update, **send to Kinesis or SQS**, then **batch insert** every minute

---

### üî∏ F. **Switch to On-Demand Capacity Mode**

If your write traffic is unpredictable or bursty:

- Avoids over-provisioning
- Pay per request
- Removes need to manage WCUs

---

### üî∏ G. **Use TTL (Time to Live) to Expire Old Items Automatically**

- Removes old data without manual deletion writes
- Saves on delete WCUs over time

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs to Watch

| Optimization                | Pros                       | Cons                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Eventually consistent reads | 50% cheaper                | May return stale data              |
| Compression                 | Smaller items = lower cost | CPU cost to compress/decompress    |
| Caching                     | Lowers RCU                 | Complexity, cache invalidation     |
| Batch writes                | Performance                | Still same WCU per item            |
| On-Demand Mode              | No management              | Can be costlier at very high scale |
| Store blobs in S3           | Saves WCU                  | More latency and system complexity |

---

## üîö Final Thoughts

üí° **Best Mix (in many use cases):**

- Use **eventually consistent reads + DAX** for read-heavy apps
- Use **batch writes** and **small, compressed items** for write-heavy apps
- Use **on-demand capacity** unless your workload is very predictable

---

Would you like a **cost estimator spreadsheet** that lets you calculate WCU/RCU costs based on item size and frequency?

Or maybe a code example (Python, Node.js, etc.) showing **batch writes + conditional updates**?
