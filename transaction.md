Below is a **deep dive** into DynamoDB transactions — from basics → advanced, with **CLI + AWS SDK v3 (JavaScript / TypeScript via `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` / `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb`)** code, real‑world scenarios, interview questions, pitfalls, and patterns. I’ll walk step by step, cover all the core parts (and some advanced caveats). If you want a shorter “cheat sheet” or slides, I can generate that too.

## Overview: What is a DynamoDB Transaction?

A _transaction_ in DynamoDB allows you to group multiple read or write operations into a single atomic unit: either **all succeed** or **none do**. This gives you ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across multiple items (possibly in multiple tables).

Key points:

- You can perform **reads** (via `TransactGetItems`) or **writes** (via `TransactWriteItems` / `ExecuteTransaction`) — but you cannot mix reads and writes in the same transaction. (Though newer PartiQL `ExecuteTransaction` API allows only read _or_ write statements; it doesn’t allow a mix). ([AWS Documentation][1])
- Each transaction is limited to a maximum number of items and total payload size (e.g. 25 items for reads, 100 items for writes in some contexts) and a 4 MB aggregate size limit. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- Under the hood, DynamoDB uses a two-phase commit-like mechanism: first “prepare” then “commit.” That means each item involved is read or written twice (so your capacity units usage needs to account for that). ([AWS Documentation][3])
- Transactions are isolated: partial updates are not visible to other operations until commit.
- You can also include _condition checks_ in the transaction (i.e. ensure something is true before proceeding).
- You can supply a `ClientRequestToken` to make the transaction idempotent (so repeated attempts don’t double apply). ([AWS Documentation][2])
- If any operation inside the transaction fails (for example, a condition check fails, or capacity exceeded, or conflict), then the entire transaction fails (no partial state). ([AWS Documentation][2])
- Because of the underlying two-phase commit, transactions have somewhat higher cost and throughput consumption, and are more susceptible to conflicts / throttling. So you should use them judiciously. ([AWS Documentation][3])

## CLI Examples

The AWS CLI supports DynamoDB transactional operations:

### `transact-write-items`

This is the write transaction (for grouping writes) CLI. ([AWS Documentation][2])

**Example:** Suppose you have two tables, `AccountA` and `AccountB`, and you want to move $100 from A to B atomically (debit one, credit the other).

You could create a file `transact-items.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "Update": {
      "TableName": "AccountA",
      "Key": { "AccountId": { "S": "A123" } },
      "UpdateExpression": "SET Balance = Balance - :amt",
      "ExpressionAttributeValues": { ":amt": { "N": "100" } },
      "ConditionExpression": "Balance >= :amt"
    }
  },
  {
    "Update": {
      "TableName": "AccountB",
      "Key": { "AccountId": { "S": "B456" } },
      "UpdateExpression": "SET Balance = Balance + :amt",
      "ExpressionAttributeValues": { ":amt": { "N": "100" } }
    }
  }
]
```

Then run:

```bash
aws dynamodb transact-write-items \
  --transact-items file://transact-items.json \
  --client-request-token transfer-req-001
```

Here:

- We use a `ConditionExpression` on the debit side to ensure Account A has enough balance.
- We pass a client request token for idempotency (so repeating the same command doesn’t double debit or credit).
- If either update fails (e.g. insufficient balance, or some other error), the other does not execute — atomic behavior.

Another example (from AWS docs) showing `Put` + `Delete`: ([AWS Documentation][2])

```json
[
  {
    "Update": {
      "Key": {
        "Artist": { "S": "Acme Band" },
        "SongTitle": { "S": "Happy Day" }
      },
      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
      "UpdateExpression": "SET AlbumTitle = :newval",
      "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
        ":newval": { "S": "Updated Album Title" }
      },
      "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(Rating)"
    }
  },
  {
    "Delete": {
      "Key": {
        "Artist": { "S": "No One You Know" },
        "SongTitle": { "S": "Call Me Today" }
      },
      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
      "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(Rating)"
    }
  }
]
```

You run:

```bash
aws dynamodb transact-write-items --transact-items file://transact-items.json
```

If any condition check fails, the transaction fails. ([AWS Documentation][2])

### `transact-get-items`

This is for reading multiple items atomically in one operation. You supply multiple `Get` requests. ([fig.io][4])

For example:

```json
{
  "TransactItems": [
    {
      "Get": {
        "TableName": "Users",
        "Key": { "UserId": { "S": "user1" } }
      }
    },
    {
      "Get": {
        "TableName": "Orders",
        "Key": { "OrderId": { "S": "order123" } }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

CLI:

```bash
aws dynamodb transact-get-items --transact-items file://get-items.json
```

This returns both items (if they exist), or fails if any read cannot be satisfied.

### `execute-transaction` (PartiQL-style)

In newer versions, AWS supports a PartiQL-based transaction API via `execute-transaction`. This allows you to issue SQL-like statements inside a transaction. ([AWS Documentation][5])

Example:

```bash
aws dynamodb execute-transaction \
  --transact-statements '[
    {
      "Statement": "UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - ? WHERE AccountId = ?",
      "Parameters": [
        { "N": "100" },
        { "S": "A123" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Statement": "UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + ? WHERE AccountId = ?",
      "Parameters": [
        { "N": "100" },
        { "S": "B456" }
      ]
    }
  ]' \
  --client-request-token txn123
```

This is syntactic sugar / an alternate interface over the underlying transaction APIs. (You still can’t mix reads and writes in one transaction here.) ([AWS Documentation][1])

---

## Using SDK v3 (JavaScript / TypeScript)

Now let’s deep dive into how to do DynamoDB transactions via the AWS SDK v3, especially with `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` and optionally `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb` (Document abstraction).

---

### Setup

```ts
import {
  DynamoDBClient,
  TransactWriteItemsCommand,
  TransactGetItemsCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";

// Create a low-level DynamoDB client
const client = new DynamoDBClient({ region: "us-east-1" });

// Optionally wrap into Document client, which handles marshalling/unmarshalling (i.e. converting JS types ↔ DynamoDB AttributeValue types)
const ddbDoc = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);
```

The Document client simplifies parameters: you can use normal JS objects rather than manually specifying `{ S: "string", N: "123" }` etc. However — caveat — not all transaction features might be fully supported via the Document abstraction. (There have been issues reported for `transactWrite()` with `Put` inside the Document client. ([GitHub][6]))

---

### Simple TransactWriteItems Example

Let’s revisit the “transfer money” scenario in code:

```ts
import {
  DynamoDBClient,
  TransactWriteItemsCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";

async function transferFunds(
  accountFrom: string,
  accountTo: string,
  amount: number
) {
  const client = new DynamoDBClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
  const ddbDoc = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

  const params = {
    TransactItems: [
      {
        Update: {
          TableName: "Accounts",
          Key: { AccountId: accountFrom },
          UpdateExpression: "SET Balance = Balance - :amt",
          ConditionExpression: "Balance >= :amt",
          ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":amt": amount,
          },
        },
      },
      {
        Update: {
          TableName: "Accounts",
          Key: { AccountId: accountTo },
          UpdateExpression: "SET Balance = Balance + :amt",
          ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":amt": amount,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    ClientRequestToken: `tx-${Date.now()}-${accountFrom}-${accountTo}`,
  };

  const cmd = new TransactWriteItemsCommand(params);
  try {
    const res = await client.send(cmd);
    console.log("Transfer succeeded", res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Transfer failed", err);
    throw err;
  }
}
```

Notes:

- We use `ConditionExpression` on the first update to ensure the source account has sufficient funds. If that fails, the entire transaction fails and the second update is not applied.
- We supply a `ClientRequestToken` for idempotency.
- If any update errors (due to conditional check failure, capacity, etc.), the entire command throws an error and no partial state is left.

You could also use the `ddbDoc` wrapper to simplify types (so you don’t have to wrap values as `{ N: "123" }`), but be cautious about feature support.

Here's a variant using Document client:

```ts
import { TransactWriteCommand } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";

async function transferFundsDoc(a: string, b: string, amt: number) {
  const client = new DynamoDBClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
  const ddbDoc = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

  const params = {
    TransactItems: [
      {
        Update: {
          TableName: "Accounts",
          Key: { AccountId: a },
          UpdateExpression: "SET Balance = Balance - :amt",
          ConditionExpression: "Balance >= :amt",
          ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":amt": amt,
          },
        },
      },
      {
        Update: {
          TableName: "Accounts",
          Key: { AccountId: b },
          UpdateExpression: "SET Balance = Balance + :amt",
          ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":amt": amt,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    ClientRequestToken: `tx-${Date.now()}`,
  };

  const cmd = new TransactWriteCommand(params);
  try {
    const result = await ddbDoc.send(cmd);
    console.log("Success", result);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Failed", e);
    throw e;
  }
}
```

**Important:** When using `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb`’s `transactWrite()`, there have been reported bugs (e.g. `Invalid attribute value type`) when using `Put` operations. So always test thoroughly. ([GitHub][6])

---

### TransactGetItems Example

Suppose you want to fetch a user's profile and their account simultaneously in a single, consistent read:

```ts
import { TransactGetItemsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

async function getUserAndAccount(userId: string) {
  const client = new DynamoDBClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
  const params = {
    TransactItems: [
      {
        Get: {
          TableName: "Users",
          Key: { UserId: userId },
        },
      },
      {
        Get: {
          TableName: "Accounts",
          Key: { AccountId: userId }, // say account id = user id
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  const cmd = new TransactGetItemsCommand(params);
  const resp = await client.send(cmd);
  return resp.Responses; // array of items
}
```

If either item is missing or cannot be fetched, the call fails.

---

### Advanced / Complex Scenarios & Patterns

#### Conditional Checks & Pre-checks

You can embed `ConditionCheck` actions within a transaction. For example, you might want to ensure that some condition is true before proceeding with multiple writes.

```ts
{
  ConditionCheck: {
    TableName: "Inventory",
    Key: { ItemId: "item123" },
    ConditionExpression: "Stock >= :req",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":req": 10 }
  }
}
```

Combined with updates or deletes elsewhere.

#### Idempotency & ClientRequestToken

By supplying a `ClientRequestToken`, you make the transaction idempotent over a short window (typically ~10 minutes). That means if the same token and operations are submitted again, DynamoDB recognizes it as the same transaction rather than executing it again. ([AWS Documentation][2])

Be cautious: if you submit with the same token but different operations, you might get an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error. ([AWS Documentation][7])

#### Retry Logic & Conflicts

Because of concurrency, transactions can fail with exceptions like `TransactionCanceledException` (due to conflicts or condition failures). Typical practice is to catch such errors and retry (with a small back-off). SDKs often do some retries automatically for certain retriable errors. But application-level retry logic is recommended. ([AWS Documentation][3])

#### Splitting Large Transactions / Saga Pattern

Transactions have limits (max items, size). If your workflow needs more than the transaction limits, you may need application-level orchestration (e.g. Saga pattern, compensating transactions). For example, break a big logical operation into multiple smaller transactions and handle rollbacks manually (or via state machines). Many systems use Step Functions + DynamoDB to manage long workflows.

Also, some use the “transaction table + image table” pattern to record in-flight operations and clean up (a form of custom logic over vanilla DynamoDB). (Earlier AWS Labs client-side transaction libraries did this.) ([GitHub][8])

#### Unique constraint enforcement

One common use case is enforcing uniqueness across attributes (e.g. unique email). Since DynamoDB doesn’t natively support unique constraints across items, you can implement it via a transaction: insert a “uniqueness marker” row plus the actual data, with condition expressions ensuring the marker does not already exist. AWS has an article about simulating unique constraints using transactions. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][9])

Example (CLI from AWS):

```bash
aws dynamodb transact-write-items --client-request-token TRANSACTION1 --transact-items '[
  {
    "Put": {
      "TableName": "User",
      "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(pk)",
      "Item": {
        "pk": { "S": "user#123" },
        "username": { "S": "bob" },
        "email": { "S": "bob@example.com" }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Put": {
      "TableName": "UsersByEmail",
      "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(email)",
      "Item": {
        "email": { "S": "bob@example.com" },
        "pk": { "S": "user#123" }
      }
    }
  }
]'
```

This ensures that email is unique, because the second `Put` in `UsersByEmail` will fail if the email entry already exists.

#### Real-world Example: Order Processing

A classic real-world use case is an e‑commerce order:

Tables:

- `Customers` (pk = CustomerId)
- `Inventory` (pk = ProductId)
- `Orders` (pk = OrderId)

When a customer places an order, you might want to:

1. Deduct inventory for the products ordered.
2. Create an order entry.
3. Update the customer’s order history.

You want all three to succeed or fail together.

You could use a transaction:

```ts
TransactItems: [
  {
    Update: {
      TableName: "Inventory",
      Key: { ProductId: "P123" },
      UpdateExpression: "SET Stock = Stock - :qty",
      ConditionExpression: "Stock >= :qty",
      ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":qty": 2 },
    },
  },
  {
    Put: {
      TableName: "Orders",
      Item: {
        OrderId: "O789",
        CustomerId: "C456",
        Products: [{ productId: "P123", qty: 2 }],
        Total: 49.99,
      },
      ConditionExpression: "attribute_not_exists(OrderId)",
    },
  },
  {
    Update: {
      TableName: "Customers",
      Key: { CustomerId: "C456" },
      UpdateExpression: "SET LastOrder = :oid",
      ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":oid": "O789" },
    },
  },
];
```

If inventory is insufficient, or order ID is duplicate, or customer update fails, the entire transaction aborts, leaving no partial state.

AWS has a worked example in their docs under “transaction example” (online marketplace) showing this pattern. ([AWS Documentation][10])

## Deep Dive: Internals, Limits, Performance, and Caveats

### Capacity & Costs

- Because of the prepare + commit phases, each item in a transaction is read/written twice. So transactions consume double capacity compared to single operations. You must plan RCU/WCU accordingly. ([AWS Documentation][3])
- When enabling transactions, you pay only for the reads/writes that are part of the transaction (double cost accounted). ([AWS Documentation][3])
- Default SDK behavior includes retries for `TransactionInProgressException` etc., so your application might consume additional RCUs/WCUs due to retries. ([AWS Documentation][3])

### Limits & Constraints

- Maximum number of items per transaction: Historically 25 for reads (TransactGet) and 100 for writes (TransactWrite), but these limits may vary or have increased. Always check the AWS regional limits. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- Total size limit: 4 MB aggregate across all items in the transaction. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- You cannot operate on the same item more than once within a single transaction (e.g. you can’t `Update` and `Delete` the same item in the same transaction). ([AWS Documentation][2])
- You cannot mix read and write operations in one transaction (for `ExecuteTransaction`). For the older APIs, writes and reads are separate APIs (TransactWrite / TransactGet). ([AWS Documentation][1])
- The transaction must operate on tables in the same AWS account and same region (no cross-region or cross-account). ([AWS Documentation][2])
- There is a limit on item collection metrics / return values.
- The transaction item operations (Put, Update, Delete, ConditionCheck) have their usual constraints (expression sizes, attribute names, etc.).
- DynamoDB Streams ordering: If you have a multi-item transaction, the stream records might not preserve the _order of writes across items_ (though within a single item, the changes are ordered). This is a nuance often overlooked. (One user observed that stream ordering across transaction items is not guaranteed) ([Reddit][11])

### Concurrency, Contention & Cancellation

- When many transactions concurrently target the same items, conflicts may occur and transactions get aborted (canceled) — you’ll see `TransactionCanceledException`. You need to catch and retry with back-off.
- Condition failures also cause cancellation.
- You should design your data model to minimize hotspots — avoid many concurrent transactions writing to the same partition / item.
- Larger transactions have a higher chance of conflict or cancellation, so keep them as small and simple as possible. ([AWS Documentation][3])

### Error Handling & Exceptions

Common exceptions to handle:

- `TransactionCanceledException`: the most common, indicating some operation in the transaction failed (due to conditional checks, conflicts, etc.). You should inspect the cancellation reasons and decide whether to retry or abort.
- `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or `ThrottlingException`: the transaction consumed too much capacity; you might back off and retry.
- `IdempotentParameterMismatchException`: if you reuse a `ClientRequestToken` but change parameters.
- `InternalServerError` or service exceptions: apply retry logic.
- `ValidationException`: e.g. invalid parameter values or exceeding limits.

When catching `TransactionCanceledException`, the error includes the reasons for each item (which sub‑operation failed and why). Use that to inform whether a retry is safe or not.

### Best Practices

- Keep transactions small (few items, minimal attributes).
- Avoid long-running transactions or mixing with heavy logic inside a transaction.
- Use `ClientRequestToken` to make your transactions idempotent (especially useful for retries).
- Add exponential back-off / jitter when retrying.
- Try to design so that items updated in transactions are not heavily contended.
- Use transactions only when really needed (i.e. when atomicity across multiple items is required). For bulk writes, use `BatchWrite` instead (which is more efficient but not atomic). ([AWS Documentation][3])
- Use PartiQL `execute-transaction` when it provides cleaner syntax.
- Monitor and provision capacity considering the double usage overhead.
- Test thoroughly in high concurrency to catch conflicts.

## Interview-style Questions (with Answers / Talking Points)

Here are some potential interview questions around DynamoDB transactions, and how you can answer or discuss them.

1. **What guarantees do DynamoDB transactions provide?**

   - They provide **atomicity** (all or nothing), **isolation** (transaction changes are not visible mid-way), **consistency** (you can enforce conditions), **durability** (committed changes persist).
   - They support multi-item, multi-table operations within the same region/account.

2. **What is the difference between `TransactWriteItems` and `BatchWriteItem`?**

   - `BatchWriteItem` is a non-transactional bulk write; some writes may succeed while others fail, it’s not atomic.
   - `TransactWriteItems` is transactional: either all succeed or none.
   - `TransactWrite` also supports conditional checks, idempotency tokens, and atomic consistency.

3. **How many items can a transaction operate on?**

   - Historically, up to 25 for `TransactGetItems`, up to 100 for `TransactWriteItems`, with a total size ≤ 4 MB. But you should check current service limits per region.
   - Cannot exceed these limits; otherwise you must split across multiple transactions or use alternative patterns.

4. **Can you mix read and write operations in a single transaction?**

   - In the classic API, you cannot. You use `TransactGetItems` for reads and `TransactWriteItems` for writes.
   - With the newer PartiQL `ExecuteTransaction`, you also cannot mix read and write statements in one transaction. ([AWS Documentation][1])

5. **What are common reasons a transaction gets cancelled?**

   - Condition check fails (e.g. `ConditionExpression` is false).
   - Conflict / contention with another concurrent transaction.
   - Throttling / lack of capacity.
   - Internal or validation errors (exceeding item size, limits, invalid expressions).

6. **How do you handle transaction retries?**

   - Catch `TransactionCanceledException` and inspect the cancellation reasons.
   - Retry with exponential back-off and jitter.
   - Use `ClientRequestToken` for idempotency so repeated attempts don’t cause duplicate effects.
   - Limit the number of retries.

7. **Explain how transactions consume capacity (RCU / WCU).**

   - Because of the prepare + commit phases, each item in the transaction is read or written twice.
   - So capacity cost is roughly double what a single write or read would consume.
   - Also, retries will further increase capacity usage.

8. **What limitations or pitfalls exist with DynamoDB transactions?**

   - Limits on number of items and total payload size.
   - Higher latency and throughput cost.
   - Susceptibility to conflict / cancellation under contention.
   - Not suitable for bulk ingestion.
   - Some features might not fully work with Document client wrappers.
   - DynamoDB Streams ordering not guaranteed across transaction items.
   - You can’t mix read + write in a transaction.

9. **How would you implement a unique constraint (e.g. unique username / email) in DynamoDB using transactions?**

   - Use a transaction that writes the user item **and** writes a marker / lookup table entry (e.g. `UsersByEmail`) with condition expressions ensuring the marker doesn’t already exist.
   - If the marker exists, the transaction fails (ensuring uniqueness).
   - Example is in AWS’s “Simulating unique constraints” article. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][9])

10. **If your operation logically affects 500 items, how do you handle that given transaction limits?**

    - You cannot do a single transaction for 500 items due to limits. You’d need to break into multiple smaller transactions.
    - Use a Saga / compensating transaction pattern: you apply pieces in order, and if one fails, roll back previous ones.
    - Alternatively, use a different database system for that workflow if atomicity across so many items is required.

---

## Advanced / “Edge” Considerations

- **Transactions + Global Tables / Replication**: Be cautious when using transactions with global (multi-region) tables. Some consistency / conflict resolution behavior may apply.
- **PartiQL support**: `execute-transaction` works with SQL-like statements, possibly improving developer productivity.
- **Document client limitations**: As flagged above, the higher-level wrapper may not support all transaction features (bugs have been reported). Always test core transaction logic using the low-level client.
- **Stream ordering nuance**: DynamoDB Streams **does not guarantee order across items** in the same transaction. If you have downstream consumers that assume strict transaction-level ordering, this could be a problem. ([Reddit][11])
- **Large attribute / big item transactions**: Because of the 4 MB size limit, if items are very large, you might hit limits.
- **Transaction browse / rollback for partial failures**: The `TransactionCanceledException` includes metadata about which operation failed and why; you should inspect that to know which commit failed.
- **Compound conditional logic**: Sometimes you may want to do cross-item conditional logic (e.g. “If A.x + B.y > 10 then update both”). You have to encode conditions carefully, or sometimes you need to read first and then perform the transaction.
- **Nested transactions**: You can’t nest transactions (i.e. no “sub-transaction” inside a transaction), so your logic must flatten operations.
- **Timeout / latency**: Transactions introduce more latency (two-phase commit) compared to simple operations. For high-throughput, low-latency use cases, minimize transaction usage.
- **Hot partitions**: If many transactions hit the same partition or item, you’ll get contention and cancellations. Be mindful in your data model.
- **Idempotent token lifetime**: The `ClientRequestToken` is valid only for a limited time (e.g. ~10 minutes). After that window, a repeated token is treated as new. So your retry strategy must account for that.
- **Cross-service orchestration**: If you need to coordinate across DynamoDB + other systems (e.g. S3, Lambda, SNS), then you must manage distributed transaction patterns or use orchestration frameworks (e.g. Saga, Step Functions).

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough: From Zero to Transaction in v3 SDK

Let me lay out a step-by-step process you might follow when building a feature with transactions:

1. **Design data model**: Identify which items across which tables need to be modified atomically. Try to minimize the number of items / complexity.

2. **Define transaction logic**: For the workflow, decide which operations (Put / Update / Delete / ConditionCheck) must be grouped.

3. **Write parameter structure**: Prepare a `TransactItems` array according to the SDK’s format (low-level or doc client). Ensure no duplicate item operations, valid keys, proper expressions, etc.

4. **Generate a `ClientRequestToken`**: Use a UUID or timestamp-based token to support idempotency.

5. **Send the transaction command**: Use `client.send(new TransactWriteItemsCommand(params))` or `ddbDoc.send(new TransactWriteCommand(params))`.

6. **Catch errors**:

   - On `TransactionCanceledException`, inspect the cancellation reasons and determine whether to retry or abort.
   - On throughput or throttling errors, back off and retry.
   - On validation or non-retriable errors, abort and bubble error to caller.

7. **Retry logic**: Implement exponential back-off + jitter for retrying transactions. Make sure retries don’t exceed token window or cause mismatches.

8. **Logging & instrumentation**: Log transaction attempts, reasons for failure, metrics (latency, capacity units consumed). Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor transaction performance.

9. **Test under concurrency**: Simulate high concurrency to see conflict rates, cancellations, and tune your model / retry logic.

10. **Fallback / compensation**: If transaction fails permanently, have fallback paths or compensation logic (e.g. send user error, roll back via business logic, etc.)

11. **Monitor & scale**: Provision capacity appropriately (consider doubling for transaction overhead), monitor throttling, errors, and adjust.

## Real-World Use Case / Scenario

### Use Case: Multi-Item Account Transfer System

Suppose you’re building a banking or fintech application where users have multiple wallets/accounts. You want to transfer money from one wallet to another, while also creating a transaction record, updating user balances, and perhaps logging a history entry — all atomically.

Tables:

- `Wallets` (pk = `WalletId`) containing fields like `Balance`, `UserId`
- `Transactions` (pk = `TxId`) recording transaction metadata
- `Users` (pk = `UserId`) storing aggregate stats like `TotalBalance`

When user wants to transfer `X` from wallet A to wallet B:

1. **ConditionCheck / Update**: Deduct X from wallet A, ensure balance ≥ X
2. **Update**: Add X to wallet B
3. **Put**: Insert a record in `Transactions` table with `TxId`, `fromWallet`, `toWallet`, `amount`, `timestamp`
4. **Update**: Update `Users` table (if needed, e.g. recalc `TotalBalance` or last activity)

You put these four operations into a single transaction `TransactWriteItems`. If any fails (say insufficient funds, or duplicate transaction Id), the entire transaction fails.

You would likely:

- Use a strong unique transaction ID (UUID) with `ConditionExpression` to ensure no duplicate `TxId`.
- Use `ClientRequestToken` for idempotency (so retries don’t duplicate).
- Expect occasional retries under concurrency.

This ensures correctness: money is neither created nor lost; either the full transfer + record logs succeed, or none do.

If your system also interacts with external services (e.g. notifying via SNS, updating external ledger), you might wrap this in a Saga: DynamoDB transaction is step one; if later steps fail, you perform compensating actions (refund, rollback) as needed.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

- DynamoDB transactions give you atomic, isolated, consistent, durable operations across multiple items / tables.
- Use `TransactWriteItems` (or PartiQL `execute-transaction`) for writes, `TransactGetItems` for reads.
- They carry higher cost, throughput overhead, and risk of conflicts, so only use when necessary.
- Handle retries, cancellation, idempotency, and contention carefully.
- For very large logical operations, break into smaller transactions or use orchestration / Saga patterns.
- Watch out for limitations and caveats of wrappers like Document client.
- In interviews, you should be able to explain how transactions work, trade-offs, sample code, and pitfalls.

Great question! The info I shared is up-to-date as of late 2025, based on the latest AWS docs, SDK v3 (JavaScript/TypeScript), and current best practices.

# 1. **Deepest DynamoDB Transaction Use Cases**

### 1.1 Atomic Cross-Item Updates (Multi-Table / Multi-Item ACID)

- Transfer money between bank accounts (debit + credit)
- Booking systems (reserve seat + update availability)
- E-commerce order + inventory deduction + payment state update
- User signup + uniqueness enforcement on email/username (using a marker item)
- Multi-step workflows requiring consistent state across several items or tables

### 1.2 Conditional Uniqueness Enforcement

DynamoDB does NOT have unique constraints. You simulate it with transactions:

- Insert user profile
- Insert "email" item to track uniqueness
- Both `Put`s with condition `attribute_not_exists()` for uniqueness guarantee
- Entire transaction aborts if email already taken

### 1.3 Distributed Locks and Semaphores

Using transactions combined with conditional writes and TTL (time to live) attributes, you can implement lightweight locking or concurrency control on items.

---

# 2. **Advanced Limitations & Gotchas**

### 2.1 Transaction Size & Item Count Limits

- Max **100 items** per `TransactWriteItems`
- Max **25 items** per `TransactGetItems`
- Max payload size **4 MB** per transaction (sum of all items)
- Cannot operate multiple times on the **same item** in one transaction (no Update + Delete on same item)
- All tables must be in the **same AWS region and account**

### 2.2 Cannot Mix Reads and Writes in Same Transaction

- `TransactWriteItems` is for writes (Put, Update, Delete, ConditionCheck)
- `TransactGetItems` is for reads
- The newer PartiQL `ExecuteTransaction` API also does **not** allow mixing reads and writes in one transaction

### 2.3 Transaction Throttling and Capacity

- Transactions consume about **2x capacity units** (read/write) due to two-phase commit
- Heavy transaction use can lead to `TransactionCanceledException` due to conflicts or throttling
- Transactions are more expensive than single-item ops — use only when needed

### 2.4 Stream Ordering and Eventual Consistency

- DynamoDB Streams do not guarantee the order of writes **across multiple items in a transaction**
- Each item’s change is ordered, but cross-item ordering is undefined, which can confuse downstream event processing
- Design your stream consumers accordingly

### 2.5 Idempotency Token Caveats

- Reusing the same `ClientRequestToken` with different requests causes errors
- Tokens are valid for a short time window (~10 minutes)
- Use tokens carefully to avoid duplicate effects and errors

---

# 3. **Alternative & Complementary Patterns**

### 3.1 Single-Item Conditional Updates Instead of Transactions

If your use case allows, design data to avoid multi-item transactions by:

- Embedding related info into one item (e.g. JSON document)
- Use conditional `UpdateItem` to prevent overwrites

### 3.2 Application-Level Sagas

For workflows too big for a single transaction (e.g. involving >100 items or complex side effects):

- Implement Saga pattern with compensating actions
- Use AWS Step Functions + DynamoDB for orchestration
- Transactions only used for **critical** atomic steps

### 3.3 Lightweight Transactions via Optimistic Locking

- Use DynamoDB’s `ConditionExpression` + a version number attribute (`version`)
- On update, increment `version` only if current `version` matches (optimistic concurrency)
- Less expensive than full transactions, but not multi-item atomic

---

# 4. **Performance & Cost**

- Transactions consume roughly **2x** read/write units (due to prepare + commit phases)
- Latency is higher than single-item ops (due to coordination)
- Throttling more likely under contention or burst usage
- For hot partitions or heavy write concurrency, transactions can suffer aborted retries
- Always monitor CloudWatch metrics for `TransactionThrottledRequests` and errors
- Use exponential backoff & jitter in retry logic
